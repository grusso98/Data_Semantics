Since the trained models are too large to be uploaded directly to github, a link to a drive folder will be shared here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/197Ac3S91o7fePeVIjbEG0sqe4p1WhFA5?usp=sharing

The directory is divided in 2 subdirectories, one containing all the CADE and w2v and the other containing glove models and the matrixes used for the embedding comparisons.
